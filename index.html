                    <p>
                    OMG guess whattt??? 3 months down, infinity to go? Do you remember those first
                    couple months of college when we were still online-only pen pals? What I remember is
                    that orientation was a lot easier because I knew that at the end of the day I would have
                    you to talk to. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Now, due to the circumstances (and the circumstances are... 😉. OMG W RIZZ WHAAAT),
                    we are an actual couple. We've both (somehow) survived meeting each other's families. 
                    I've been to Congers, you've been to Maryland. And even if we go through the occassional rough
                        stretch, at the end of the day we know we'll <em>make it</em> because we have good communication skills and
                    friends to lovers is the healthiest relationship trope.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To clarify, "making it" includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A loft or studio apartment</li>
                        <li>A movie shelf</li>
                        <li>Making dinner together (I cook and you sit on the counter with wine)</li>
                        <li>Daily fruit salads, optionally topped with cool whip</li>
                        <li>A brownstone</li>
                        <li>Weekly phone-free coffee dates</li>
                        <li>Traveling in time off</li>
                        <li>Household items that resemble other things</li>  
                    </ul>
                    <p>The list goes on and on. There's so much more I could say here, but I'll spare you and keep it
                    short. Fuck Ice. Free Palestine. Don't make journeys on treacherous roads. Daisy Baker you are
                    my best friend, and my daiy goal is to be yours. I love you, I cherish our time together. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Would you do me this great honor, and be my Valentine?</p>
                    
                    <p>-Sam</p>
